                    <p>I am a web developer based in programming Hero
                        I have been working as a freelance designer and front-end developer since 2007.
                        Iâ€™ve always been someone who has both a creative and a logical side.
                        When I discovered web design in college, I realized it would be the perfect fit.
                        I could use my creative side to design and my logical side to code.
                        As a bonus, being both designer and developer allows me to make sure no detail is lost in translation.</p>
